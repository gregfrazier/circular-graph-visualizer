# Circular Graph Visualizer
Step through a graph in an interesting way
  
In 2012, we needed a way to display a graph that had the following requirements:
- Made sense to an average user
- Fit in small screen real estate
- Was somewhat pleasing to the eye
  
After several attempts to build out a graph, I went with something a little different... a fanned out deck of cards.

This visualizer was used for a few years, before I built a new visualizer that displayed a graph in a more traditional way along with the asthetic of looking like it was drawn on a chalkboard.
  
Personally, I haven't seen any graph visualizers that do this although I'm sure I'm not the only one. I found this code recently (it's 2022 at time of writing) and wanted to finally put it up for all to see. The Javascript is written like other js in the early 2010s, with prototyped methods and variable hoisting. Don't expect a masterpiece.  
  
Another warning, this is POC code so it's sloppy and incomplete. The arrows are either right or left facing and the painting of graphic elements aren't in the right order.
